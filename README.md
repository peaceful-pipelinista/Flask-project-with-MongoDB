# Flask-project-with-MongoDB

1. I created a Flask project with a frontend and a backend, both with their own code in separate folders.
2. The frontend has a form that collects user data: name and email address
3. When the form is submitted. The data is sent to the backend using an HTTP POST request.
4. The backend receives data and inserts it into MongoDB Atlas.
5. Appropriate messages are displayed according to what happens: success or error.
6. MongoDB connection details are stored successfully using environment variables.
